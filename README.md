# Disconnect 4 (Rough Draft)

## Game Modes

### Classic Mode

- Each player will take turns dropping tokens into the game board. To drop a token, simply click on the column you would like to drop your token in. Once a player has 4 tokens in a row in any direction (horizontally,vertically,diagonally), that player wins. 

### Disconnect Mode

- This game as the same win condition as classic mode. You must get four of your tokens in a row in any directions. However, you are now given the option of moving your opponent's token to a different column instead of placing a token for your turn. To select what move you would like to do (Drop or Move). Click the button at the bottom of the board before selecting a column. 

#### Moves

1. Drop

    - Click the drop button at the bottom then select the column where you want to place your token. 

2. Move

    - Click the move button at the bottom. Now you have to click on a column that has your opponent token on the highest row. Your opponent's token will now disappear. Next, click on the column you would to move the token and the token wll be moved to that column (if there is available space).

    - If you click on a column that contains no tokens, or does not contain your opponents token on the highest row. No worries, It will still be your turn and the drop/move buttons will reappear for you. 

    - **Be Careful**: If you move your opponent's token into a spot where they an four in a row, the game will still count that as a win for your opponent. 

## Options

### Change your token color

- It is easy to change your token color. Click on the option button and you will be shown "Player 1 Color:" with a textbox. All you have to do is either type in the color you would like ("red", "blue", "green" etc). As well, you can type in the hex value of the color you want to use. Once you have typed in the color, press the "submit" button under closest to the text box. Now, the color will be used in your next game. 
   - No troubles if you happen to type in a random word such as "dog" instead of a color into the text box and press submit. The game checks if the word is a color before completing the submission. 
 
## To-Do List
1. **Win Conditions**s
- Game is able to detect when an 4 in a row has been made. However, there is no screen or effect played when someone has won. This means the game will continue to run even if a 4 in a row has been detected.

   - **Plan:** Disable controls and say which player won. (Draw Line through all 4 token)
2. **Upgrade UI**
- The UI, especially the menus, appear as if it was made in the 90s. 

  - **Plan:** Apply more color variety outside of blue. Aswell as adding a bit more visual effects such as opacity. Also, give more feedback to the user such as when the color is changed in the options.
3. **Network Play** (Ambitious Goal)
- Add network play to the game to allow people use two devices to play the game.

  - **No current plan**.
